I want to tell you, my head is filled with things to say When you're here all those words they seem to slip away When I get near you the games begin to drag me down It's alright, I'll make you maybe next time around But if I seem to act unkind It's only me, it's not my mind That is confusing things I want to tell you, I feel hung up and I don't know why I don't mind, I could wait for ever, I've got time Sometimes I wish I knew you well Then I could speak my mind and tell you Maybe you'd understand I want to tell you, I feel hung up and I don't know why I don't mind, I could wait for ever, I've got time I've got time, I've got time
