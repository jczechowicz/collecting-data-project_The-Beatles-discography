Gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local D.J. It's a rockin' rhythm record I want my jockey to play Roll over Beethoven, gotta hear it again today You know my temperature's risin' and the jukebox blows a fuse My heart's beatin' rhythm and my soul keeps on singin' the blues Roll over Beethoven, tell Tschaikowsky the news Well if you feel you like it Go get your lover then reel and rock it Roll it over and move on up just A trifle further and reel and rock it Roll it over, roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues Early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you the warnin' Don't you step on my blue suede shoes Hey diddle diddle, I am playin' my fiddle, ain't got nothin' to lose Roll over Beethoven rockin' in two by two You know she wiggles like a glow worm, dance like a spinnin' top She's got a crazy partner, oughta see 'em reel and rock Long as she got a dime the music will never stop Roll over Beethoven Roll over Beethoven Roll over Beethoven Roll over Beethoven Roll over Beethoven, dig to these rhythm and blues
