Every night when everybody has fun, here am I sitting all on my own, It won't be long yeah, yeah, it won't be long yeah, yeah, it won't be long yeah, yeah, till I belong to you. Since you left me I'm so alone, now you're coming, you're coming home, I'll be good like I know I should, you're coming home, you're coming home. Every night the tears come down from my eyes, every day I've done nothing but cry. It won't be long yeah, yeah. Since you left me I'm so alone, now you're coming, you're coming home, I'll be good like I know I should, you're coming home, you're coming home. Every day we'll be happy, I know, now I know that you won't leave me no more. It won't be long yeah, yeah.
