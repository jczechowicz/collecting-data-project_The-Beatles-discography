Here I stand, head in hand, turn my face to the wall If she's gone I can't go on, feeling two foot small Everywhere people stare each and every day I can see them laugh at me and I hear them say Hey you've got to hide your love away Hey you've got to hide your love away How can I even try I can never win Hearing them, seeing them in the state I'm in How could she say to me 'love will find a way' Gather round all you clowns, let me hear you say Hey you've got to hide your love away Hey you've got to hide your love away
