Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving on our way back home
We're on our way home, we're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards, writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches on our way back home
We're on our way home, we're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats, standing so low in the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere on our way back home
We're on our way home, we're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats, standing so low in the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere on our way back home
We're on our way home, we're on our way home
We're going home

[We're going home
You better believe it
Good-bye]
