We were talking about the space between us all And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion Never glimpse the truth - then it's far too late When they pass away We were talking about the love we all could share When we find it to try our best to hold it there With our love, with our love we could save the world If they only knew Try to realise it's all within yourself No one else can make you change And to see you're really only very small And life flows on within you and without you We were talking about the love that's gone so cold And the people who gain the world and lose their soul They don't know, they can't see Are you one of them When you've seen beyond yourself Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there And the time will come when you see we're all one And life flows on within you and without you
