Lovely Rita meter maid nothing can come between us When it gets dark I tow your heart away Standing by a parking meter when I caught a glimpse of Rita Filling in a ticket in her little white book In a cap she looked much older And the bag across her shoulder Made her look a little like a military man Lovely Rita meter maid may I inquire discreetly When are you free to take some tea with me Took her out and tried to win her had a laugh and over dinner Told her I would really like to see her again Got the bill and Rita paid it Took her home and nearly made it Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two Lovely Rita meter maid where would I be without you give us a wink and make me think of you Lovely meter maid Rita meter maid oh, Lovely Rita meter, meter maid
