When I get older losing my hair many years from now will you still be sending me a valentine birthday greeting, bottle of wine If I'd been out till quarter to three would you lock the door Will you still need me Will you still feed me When I'm sixty-four You'll be older too And if you say the word I could stay with you I could be handy mending a fuse when your light have gone You can knit a sweater by the fireside Sunday mornings, go for a ride Doing the garden, digging the weeds Who could ask for more Will you still need me Will you still feed me When I'm sixty-four Every summer we can rent a cottage on the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear We shall scrimp and save Grandchildren on your knee Vera, Chuck, and Dave Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view indicate precisely what you mean to say yours sincerely wasting away Give me your answer fill in a form mine forever more Will you still need me Will you still feed me When I'm sixty-four
