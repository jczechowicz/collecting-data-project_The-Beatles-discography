Sheep dog standing in the rain Bull grog doing it again Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles What make you think you're something special when you smile Childlike no on understand Jack knife in your sweaty hands Some kind of innocence is measured out in years You don't know what it's like to listen to you fears You can talk to me You can talk to me You can talk to me If you're lonely, you can talk to me Big man walking in the park Wigwam frightened of the dark Some kind of solitude is measured out in you You think you know but you haven't got a clue You can talk to me You can talk to me You can talk to me If you're lonely, you can talk to me Hey Bulldog
