Half of what I say is meaningless But I say it just to rich you, Julia Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me So I sing a song of love, Julia Julia, sea-shell eyes, windy smile, calls me So I sing a song of love, Julia Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering in the sun Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me So I sing a song of love, Julia When I cannot sing my heart I can only speak my mind, Julia Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me So I sing a song of love, Julia Hum hum hum... calls me So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia
