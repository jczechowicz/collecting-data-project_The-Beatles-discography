You say you want a revolution
Well you know we all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well you know we all wanna change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright, alright, alright

You say you got a real solution
Well you know we'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know we're doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait

Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright, alright, alright

You say you'll change the constitution
Well you know we all wanna change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well you know you better free you mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright, alright, alright

Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
