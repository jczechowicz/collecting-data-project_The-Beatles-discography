Born a poor young country boy Mother Nature's Son All day long I'm sitting singing songs for every one Sit beside a mountain stream See her waters rise Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies tu tu tu, tu, du tu Find me in my field of grass Mother Nature's Son swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun tu tu, yeah yeah yeah Ooo Ooo Ah, Mother Nature's Son
